0. Define a class for a three-dimensional space. This should be able to:
    0. Determine where points should go on the screen based on their
       three-dimensional coordinates.
    1. Define a three-dimensional graph (e.g., x, y, and z axes) which can
       be arbitrarily rotated or zoomed.
    2. Draw a line from one point to another.

1. Define a class for three-dimensional points. This should be able to:
    0. Tell the space class where it is.
    1. Move linearly along x, y, and z axes.
    2. Rotate itself about an arbitrary line.

2. Define a class for three-dimensional triangles. This should:
    0. Be made of points as described in step 1, and thereby inherit the
       abilities of those points.
    1. Be able to tell the space class to draw its edges.
