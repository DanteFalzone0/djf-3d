0. Define a class for a three-dimensional space. This should be able to:
    0. Determine where points should go on the screen based on their
       three-dimensional coordinates. (completed)
    1. Define a three-dimensional graph (e.g., x, y, and z axes) which can
       be arbitrarily rotated or zoomed. (completed)
    2. Draw a line from one point to another. (completed)
(Step 0 is completed.)

1. Define a class for three-dimensional points. This should be able to:
    0. Tell the space class where it is. (completed)
    1. Move linearly along x, y, and z axes. (completed)
    2. Rotate itself about an arbitrary line. (not applicable; Space
    class does the rotating)
(Step 1 is effectively completed, though three-dimensional points wound up
being a typedef struct rather than a class.)

2. Define a class for three-dimensional triangles. This should:
    0. Be made of points as described in step 1, and thereby inherit the
       abilities of those points. (completed)
    1. Be able to tell the space class to draw its edges. (completed)
(Step 2 is completed. I suppose the next thing to do is make more ambitious plans,
perhaps stuff like opaque surfaces and raytracing. This is a fun educational project!)
